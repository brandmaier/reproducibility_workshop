# Statistical Data Analysis

- Replication attempt of articles in journal _Cognition_ `r Citep(bib, "hardwicke2018data")`
- Out of 35 published articles with open code and data, the results of 22 articles could be reproduced, 
- Further assistance from the original authors was required in 11 cases
- For 13 articles, at least one outcome could not be reproduced—even with the original authors’ assistance. 
---
# Statistical Data Analysis

- in 62 registered reports only 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available `r Citet(bib,"obels2020analysis")`. 
- The authors could execute only 31 of the scripts without error
- They reproduced the results of only 21 articles (within a reasonable time). 
--
- Lesson: Just because it's open data/code, it's not necessarily useful
 
---
# Power Analysis

Reproducibility of power analyses `r Citet(bib,"thibault2024evaluation")`:

- 2% reproduced
- (likely) 28% reproduced with additional assumptions 
- 75% not reported transparently enough to assess reproducibility (e.g., unclear whether power analysis matches later statistical analysis)

# How should we make our work reproducible?

# Rule 1: Keep your stuff together!

Always avoid local paths. Probably a good idea to add this to your `.Rprofile`:

```{r echo=TRUE}
setwd <- function(...) { stop("Bad boy!")}
```
--
Then:
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/brandmaier/SOEP")
```

> Error in `setwd()`: Bad boy!

---
# Use `here`

Use RStudio and R projects instead

The command `here` retrieves files relative to project root

```{r}
here("data/soep.csv")
```

*Project should be self-contained*

# Sources of Failure to Reproduce Results

1. *Multiple versions of scripts/data* (e.g., dataset has changed over, i.e., was further cleaned or extended)

--

2. *Multiple scripts* in a pipeline; unclear which scripts should be executed in which order

--

3. *Copy&paste errors* (e.g., inconsistency between reported result and reproduced result)

--

4. Broken *software dependencies* (e.g., analysis broken after update, missing package, just comes out differently on a different computer )

### Version Control

.pull-left[

- Version control systems (VCS) such as `git` record changes to a set of files over time so that you can restore specific versions
later.

- VCS guarantee that code and data are exactly the same
version as used for publication.

- Reduces the number of dead or dysfunctional code lines (deletion is safe and branches help separate productive and experimental code)

# GNU Make
---


# Solution: Make

## A Makefile

- contains a number of recipes

- Each recipe contains its ingredients (=dependencies) and commands to create the product

- There is a default recipe (defined entry point)

- By convention, there is an .emph[„all“] recipe to create everything 

- Recipes can depend on other recipes and/or files

---

# Make

## Why Make?

- A single, well-defined entry point for your analysis (default target):
	`make`
	
- Management of all external dependencies in one file via (dependend) targets, such as 

  - Installing extra software

  - Starting external programs (such as pre-processing pipelines)

  - Downloading data from external repositories

---

# Key features

Missing ingredients will be generated,  
.small[*e.g., if the cleaned data is missing, the raw data is first cleaned.*]

Newer ingredients trigger updates,  
.small[*e.g., new data leads to recreation of the whole manuscript.*]

Always the same "button" that triggers reproduction,  
.small[*e.g., regardless of programming language, file format, and intermediate steps.*]

---
# Example Makefile

### Makefile Schema

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
recipe name: ingredients
  instructions
```

--

### An example Makefile
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
all: manuscript.pdf

manuscript.pdf: data/iris_prepped.csv manuscript.Rmd
  Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("manuscript.Rmd")'

data/iris_prepped.csv: R/preprocess_data.R data/iris.csv
  Rscript -e 'source("R/preprocess_data.R")'
```

---

# Native R alternative?

Alternative: build automation using the `targets` package `r Citet(bib,"targets2021")` 

- using `tar_target(y, f(x))` instead of `y <- f(x)`
- then `tar_make()` builds/updates all targets
- like in Make, things are built only if they changed
- built-in visualization of dependency graph

Containerization

--------------------------------- -->

# Containerization



---


class: inverse, middle
# Problem: Broken *software dependencies* ('dependency hell')
---

# Docker

A Docker container is like a shareable virtual machine that runs identically on any computer (Linux, macOS, Windows)

- You can either provide a short .emph[recipe] how to create a container (few kilobytes) or 
- the entire .emph[container] (few gigabytes)

---

# Docker Recipes

Recipes are instructions how to create a container from publicly available sources, e.g., 

-   Rocker project (Boettiger & Eddelbuettel, 2017), with pre-configured Debian images including R/Rstudio
<p style="color:white">- Microsoft R Application Network (MRAN) providing CRAN snapshots in their „time machine“ (out of service now!)</p>

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
{{FROM rocker/verse:3.6.1}}
ARG BUILD_DATE=2019-11-11
RUN install2.r --error --skipinstalled here lavaan
WORKDIR /home/rstudio
```

# The easy way

- The collection of installed packages is a _library_ in R

- The R package `renv` (Ushey & Wickham, 2024) separates system library from _project-specific local libraries_ in R

- Key concept: _isolation_ of your project's dependencies from your system and other projects (different projects can use different package versions)

---

# Components

- The project library, renv/library, is a library that contains all packages currently used by your project

- the renv.lock file, which contains meta data about the local library

- A project R profile `.Rprofile`, which is loaded once a project is loaded (remember `setwd()`)

---

# Commands

- Create a private R library with `renv::init()` (the project will now always rely on the local library)

- Update a library with `renv::snapshot()` (e.g. when updating packages to a newer version)

- Restore a library with `renv::restore()`

# The case of pseudo random numbers

- Pseudo random numbers are important in modern statistics, e.g. permutation tests, bootstrapping, random forests but also for reproducible allocation of participants to experimental conditions

- PRN generators can be thought of as long lists of numbers that repeat only after a very long time (efficiently represented as a mathematical function); the list is determined by a starting condition (_seed_)

- For reproducibility, we need to fix that initial _seed_ (ideally by another random process)

---

# Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

Here are some examples of non-reproducible code that cannot be captured easily from within a given R environment

### 1.	Bugfix in random number generator in R between R 3.5 and R 3.6

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1234); 
sample(1:10, 5) 
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
2 6 5 8 9 (R3.5)
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
10 6 5 4 1 (R3.6.1)
```

---

# Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

#  Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

# There is a need for reproducible computational environments


---

# Containers

### Docker containers 

- guarantee identical execution of its contents across platforms (and time) including cloud computing

--

- can run interactively: R/Rstudio can run in the container (i.e., there is no need to ever run the analysis in your local computing environment)

--

- Analyses can be run in different containers (simulating different package versions) to find out what downstream updates broke your code / your results

title: My worst academic fails
author: Andreas Brandmaier
date: 2020-11-17
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header (repro)

`repro` extends the YAML header of R Markdown to track dependencies on .emph[code] (internal scripts and external packages) and .emph[data] files.

---
# Example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: My worst academic fails
author: Andreas Brandmaier
date: 2020-11-17
repro:
  packages:
    - usethis
    - fs

  scripts:
    - R/clean.R
  data:
    mycars: data/mtcars.csv
output: html_document
---
```


---

# System setup with repro

Load the package:

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(repro)
```

Run some checks:

```{r}
check_git()
check_make()
check_docker()
```

---

# Project setup with `repro`

- Use `repro::automate()` to make an existing RMarkdown analysis reproducible

- creates a Dockerfile & Makefile based on every RMarkdown in the project folder

- use `automate_load_packages()` to load all packages in your script, `automate_load_data`() for data, and  `automate_load_scripts()` to attach external scripts

# Outlook

	
## Long-term sustainability is a continuing challenge for the community

- We need academic repositories that

  - are freely accessible (no commercial interests)
  - guarantee long-term reproducibility (independent of short-term grants)
  - provide not only disk space but software infrastructure and computational environments

- We need to better recognize the efforts of maintaining scientific software (such as repro and many others) and curating digital collections

# Extract only necessary bits from a model and verify them

The `broom` package has a generic function `tidy` with model-specific functions (e.g., lm, anova, factanal, glm, lavaan, gam,...) to extract all relevant parameter estimates:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- rnorm(10)
broom::tidy(lm(y~x))
```

# Outlook: PAC 

- preregistration currently entail a lot of work because we need two write two manuscripts (prereg + final ms)

- preregistrations still suffer from ambiguities of written language, omissions, underdefined processes

- With reproducible pipelines, we could move towards Preregistration as Code (PAC)

---
# Outlook: PAC 

Advantages

- Write your manuscript once with everything but the discussion
- Generate all tables and figures based on simulated data
- Once real data is collected, replace data, reproduce manuscript
- Deviate from original plan if necessary, summarize, also: all changes are _transparently_ documented in git
- Write discussion, done.

# How would this look in practice?

![https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-tutorial/blob/main/preregistration.Rmd]

Modifications we had to make after the simulated PAC:

- recoding gender from (1,2) to (male, female)
- removal of NA values was missing
- half of the items of Machiavellianism are reverse-coded
