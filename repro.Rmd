# Power Analysis

Reproducibility of power analyses (Thibault et al., 2024):

- 2% reproduced
- (likely) 28% reproduced with additional assumptions 
- 75% not reported transparently enough to assess reproducibility (e.g., unclear whether power analysis matches later statistical analysis)

# Version Control

### Version Control

.pull-left[

- Version control systems (VCS) such as `git` record changes to a set of files over time so that you can restore specific versions
later.

- VCS guarantee that code and data are exactly the same
version as used for publication.

- Reduces the number of dead or dysfunctional code lines (deletion is safe and branches help separate productive and experimental code)

# Long-Term Storage

- GitHub has no long-term guarantees for the availability of its service

- even though they do .emph[LOCKSS] (for Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe, e.g., the Artic World Archive)

--

- Mirror snapshots with meta-data and DOI to other providers (e.g., Zenodo, FigShare, OSF)

- This helps making the repository (F)indable (as in FAIR)

# GNU Make
---


# Solution: Make

## A Makefile

- contains a number of recipes

- Each recipe contains its ingredients (=dependencies) and commands to create the product

- There is a default recipe (defined entry point)

- By convention, there is an .emph[„all“] recipe to create everything 

- Recipes can depend on other recipes and files

---

# Make

## Why Make?

- A single, well-defined entry point for your analysis (default target):
	`make`
	
- Management of all external dependencies in one file via (dependend) targets, such as 

  - Installing extra software

  - Starting external programs (such as pre-processing pipelines)

  - Downloading data from external repositories

---

# Example Makefile

### Makefile Schema

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
recipe name: ingredients
  instructions
```

--

### An example Makefile
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
all: manuscript.pdf

manuscript.pdf: data/iris_prepped.csv manuscript.Rmd
  Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("manuscript.Rmd")'

data/iris_prepped.csv: R/prepare_data.R data/iris.csv
  Rscript -e 'source("R/prepare_data.R")'
```

Containerization

--------------------------------- -->

# Containerization



---



# Docker

A Docker container is like a shareable virtual machine that runs identically on any computer (Linux, macOS, Windows)

- You can either provide a short .emph[recipe] how to create a container (few kilobytes) or 
- the entire .emph[container] (few gigabytes)

--

Recipes are instructions how to create a container from publicly available sources, e.g., 

-   Rocker project (Boettiger & Eddelbuettel, 2017), with pre-configured Debian images including R/Rstudio
-   .del[Microsoft R Application Network (MRAN) providing CRAN snapshots in their „time machine“]

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
FROM rocker/verse:3.6.1
ARG BUILD_DATE=2019-11-11
RUN install2.r --error --skipinstalled here lavaan
WORKDIR /home/rstudio
```

---

# The easy way

- The R package `renv` helps you to set up and restore project-specific local environments in R

- Create a private R library with `renv::init()` (the project will now always rely on the local library)

- Update a library with `renv::snapshot()` 

- Restore a library with `renv::restore()`

# Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

Here are some examples of non-reproducible code that cannot be captured easily from within a given R environment

### 1.	Bugfix in random number generator in R between R 3.5 and R 3.6

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1234); 
sample(1:10, 5) 
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
2 6 5 8 9 (R3.5)
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
10 6 5 4 1 (R3.6.1)
```

---

# Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

Confidence intervals (95%) of a simple regression coefficient estimate (with identical random seed):

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
[1] "R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)"

2.5 % 97.5 %
 0.0097 0.3842
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
 [1] "R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)"

 2.5 % 97.5 %
 -0.0005 0.3748
```
]

.footnote[Note that the results are not reproduced but replicated.]

---

#  Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R
	
### 2.	Locale-dependent behavior (e.g., English vs Lithuania):

```{r eval=FALSE}
sort(state.abb) 

[1] "AK" "AL" "AR" "AZ" "CA" "CO" "CT" "DE" "FL" "GA" "HI" "IA" 
[13] "ID" "IL" "IN" "KY" "KS" "LA" "MA" "MD" "ME" "MI" "MN" "MO" 
[25] "MS" "MT" "NC" "ND" "NE" "NH" "NY" "NJ" "NM" "NV" "OH" "OK" 
[37] "OR" "PA" "RI" "SC" "SD" "TN" "TX" "UT" "VA" "VT" "WA" "WI" 
[49] "WY" "WV"
```

---


# Containers

### Docker containers 

- guarantee identical execution of its contents across platforms (and time) including cloud computing

--

- can run interactively: R/Rstudio can run in the container (i.e., there is no need to ever run the analysis in your local computing environment)

--

- Analyses can be run in different containers (simulating different package versions) to find out what downstream updates broke your code / your results

# YAML header (R Markdown)

A standard YAML header:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: My worst academic fails
author: Andreas Brandmaier
date: 2020-11-17
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header (repro)

`repro` extends the YAML header of R Markdown to track dependencies on .emph[code] (internal scripts and external packages) and .emph[data] files.

---
# Example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: My worst academic fails
author: Andreas Brandmaier
date: 2020-11-17
repro:
  packages:
    - usethis
    - fs
    - aaronpeikert/repro@d09def75df
  scripts:
    - R/clean.R
  data:
    mycars: data/mtcars.csv
output: html_document
---
```


---

# System setup with repro

Load the package:

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(repro)
```

Run some checks:

```{r}
check_git()
check_make()
check_docker()
```

---

# Project setup with `repro`

- Use `repro::automate()` to make an existing RMarkdown analysis reproducible

- creates a Dockerfile & Makefile based on every RMarkdown in the project folder

- use `automate_load_packages()` to load all packages in your script, `automate_load_data`() for data, and  `automate_load_scripts()` to attach external scripts

---

# Reproduction

To reproduce a project completely inside a container:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(repro)
rerun()
```


---


# Outlook

	
## Long-term sustainability is a continuing challenge for the community

- We need academic repositories that

  - are freely accessible (no commercial interests)
  - guarantee long-term reproducibility (independent of short-term grants)
  - provide not only disk space but software infrastructure and computational environments

- We need to better recognize the efforts of maintaining scientific software (such as repro and many others) and curating digital collections
